English version of the open source interpreter for the visual novel scripting engine NScripter.

Will provide ports and compiles for PSP, Dreamcast, Linux, Mac OSX, Windows, Wii, DS.

I guess I will provide binaries and sources for the different ports. Have been pretty interested in porting them to different platforms.
